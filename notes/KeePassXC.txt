KeePassXC Browser Integration on OpenBSD
----------------------------------------

These are my notes on getting KeePassXC'Gs browser integration working
on Firefox, Chromium, and Iridium on OpenBSD 7.1:

1. Install the keepassxc--browser package

   $ doas pkg_add keepassxc--browser

2. Add the following lines to the browser's unveil.main to allow the 
   browser to read /usr/local/bin and to execute keepassxc-proxy: 

   /usr/local/bin r
   /usr/local/bin/keepassxc-proxy rx

   For Firefox, update:  /etc/firefox/unveil.main 
   For Chromium, update: /etc/chromium/unveil.main
   For Iridium, update:  /etc/iridium/unveil.main 

3. Create a native messaging hosts file to allow the browser to 
   communicate with keepassxc-proxy:

   For Firefox, create the file ~/.config/mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/org.keepassxc.keepassxc_browser.json with the following contents:

   {
       "allowed_extensions": [
	   "keepassxc-browser@keepassxc.org"
       ],
       "description": "KeePassXC integration with native messaging support",
       "name": "org.keepassxc.keepassxc_browser",
       "path": "/usr/local/bin/keepassxc-proxy",
       "type": "stdio"
   }

   For Chromium, create the file ~/.config/chromium/NativeMessagingHosts/org.keepassxc.keepassxc_browser.json with the following contents:

   {
       "allowed_origins": [
	   "chrome-extension://oboonakemofpalcgghocfoadofidjkkk/"
       ],
       "description": "KeePassXC integration with native messaging support",
       "name": "org.keepassxc.keepassxc_browser",
       "path": "/usr/local/bin/keepassxc-proxy",
       "type": "stdio"
   }

   For Iridium, create the file ~/.config/iridium/NativeMessagingHosts/org.keepassxc.keepassxc_browser.json with the following contents:

   {
       "allowed_origins": [
	   "chrome-extension://oboonakemofpalcgghocfoadofidjkkk/"
       ],
       "description": "KeePassXC integration with native messaging support",
       "name": "org.keepassxc.keepassxc_browser",
       "path": "/usr/local/bin/keepassxc-proxy",
       "type": "stdio"
   }

4. Start KeePassXC, e.g.:

   $ keepassxc &

5. Start the browser, e.g.:

   $ firefox &

   or

   $ chrome --enable-unveil --incognito

   or

   $ iridium --incognito

6. Install the KeePassXC plugin:

   For Firefox: 

   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser

   For Iridium and Chromiun: 

   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepassxc-browser/oboonakemofpalcgghocfoadofidjkkk

7. Follow the standard KeePassXC steps for enabling browser integration:

   https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_GettingStarted.html#_configure_keepassxc_browser

After restarting the browser, it should be possible to connect to a running 
instance of KeePassXC with an unlocked database.
