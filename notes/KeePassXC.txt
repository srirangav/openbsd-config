KeePassXC
---------

These are my notes on getting KeePassXC's browser integration working
on Firefox on OpenBSD 7.1:

1. Install the keepassxc--browser package

   $ doas pkg_add keepassxc--browser

2. Add the following to /etc/firefox/unveil.main:

   /usr/local/bin/keepassxc-proxy rx

3. Create the file ~/.config/mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/org.keepassxc.keepassxc_browser.json with the following contents:

   {
       "allowed_extensions": [
	   "keepassxc-browser@keepassxc.org"
       ],
       "description": "KeePassXC integration with native messaging support",
       "name": "org.keepassxc.keepassxc_browser",
       "path": "/usr/local/bin/keepassxc-proxy",
       "type": "stdio"
   }

4. Start KeePassXC, e.g.:

   $ keepassxc &

5. Start FireFox, e.g.:

   $ firefox &

6. Install the KeePassXC Firefox plugin:

   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser

7. Follow the standard KeePassXC steps for enabling browser integration:

   https://keepassxc.org/docs/KeePassXC_GettingStarted.html#_configure_keepassxc_browser

After restarting Firefox, it should be possible to connect to a running 
instance of KeePassXC with an unlocked database.
