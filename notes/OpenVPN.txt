OpenVPN on OpenBSD
------------------

These are my notes for connecting an OpenBSD 7.1 host to a VPN provider 
that supports OpenVPN connections.

1. Install OpenVPN:

   $ doas pkg_add openvpn

2. Install unzip (often needed to extract configuration files, which
   may be provided by the VPN provider in zip format):

   $ doas pkg_add unzip

3. Download the OpenVPN configuration files for your VPN provider

4. Make a directory to for the OpenVPN configuration files.  I use
   ~/.config/openvpn/[VPN Provider]:

   $ mkdir -p ~/.config/openvpn/[VPN Provider]

5. Extract the OpenVPN configuration files into this directory, for
   example:

   $ cd ~/.config/openvpn/[VPN Provider] && unzip [VPN Provider].zip

6. Start OpenVPN using the desired configuration file:

   $ doas openvpn --config [config].ovpn

   After entering the appropriate username and password, if the VPN
   connection was successfully you should see a message in the following
   format:

   [DATE] [TIME] Initialization Sequence Completed

7. To close then just press ^C (Control-C)

Notes
-----

1. If you are using KeePassXC, you can have OpenVPN retrieve your login
   information as follows:

   $ keepassxc-cli show [KeePassXC DB file] [Entry Name] \
     -a Username -a Password | \
     doas openvpn --config [config].ovpn --auth-user-pass /dev/stdin

   You may need to press return once to get the doas password prompt.

2. If you see the following warning:

      WARNING: No server certificate verification method has been enabled.  
      See http://openvpn.net/howto.html#mitm for more info.

   Add tbe followig line to the [config].opvn that you are using:

       remote-cert-tls server

   From: https://community.netgear.com/t5/Orbi/OpenVPN-warning-No-server-certificate-verification-method-has/td-p/1626831

3. If you see the follwing error:

      TLS Error: TLS key negotiation failed to occur within 60 seconds 
      (check your network connectivity)

   Make sure that the openvpn tcp and ucp ports are not blocked by pf(4)
   (by default port 1194) and that tcp port 4443 is not blocked by pf(4)
