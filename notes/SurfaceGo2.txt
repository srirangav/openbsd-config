Surface Go 2 and OpenBSD
------------------------

These are my notes on running OpenBSD 7.1 on a Surface Go 2.

The most helpful link to get started with OpenBSD on a Surface
Go 2 is Joshua Stein webpage on about running OpenBSD on a
Surface Go 2:

    https://jcs.org/2020/05/15/surface_go2

The Linux Surface project's Surface Go 2 page is also helpful:

    https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Surface-Go-2

In addition, the following links are very helpful about running
OpenBSD on laptops generally:

Booting / Shutdown / Restart
----------------------------

1. In addition to Joshua Stein's notes, I found Microsoft's support
   pages on booting from a USB drive and forcing a shutdown / reboot
   helpful:

   https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/boot-surface-from-a-usb-device-fe7a7323-8d1d-823d-be17-9aec89c4f9f5
   
   https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/force-a-shutdown-and-restart-your-surface-cf13996e-fef0-dbb0-1e94-cdd7ff88b840

2. Enabling apmd(8) for power / battery monitoring:

   $ doas rcctl enable apmd
   $ doas rcctl set apmd flags -A
   $ doas rcctl start apmd

   From: https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2021-05-03-openbsd-getting-started.html
   
3. To hibernate (no other sleep mode works on the Surface Go 2):

   $ apm -Z

Firmware
--------

1. Post-install, I had to download the following files on to USB drive
   on a different computer because the Surface Go 2's WiFi needs firmware:

    http://firmware.openbsd.org/firmware/7.1/iwx-firmware-20211101.tgz
    http://firmware.openbsd.org/firmware/7.1/intel-firmware-20220207v0.tgz
    http://firmware.openbsd.org/firmware/7.1/inteldrm-firmware-20211027.tgz

2. Once downloaded, I ran fw_update as follows (the USB drive was
   mounted on /mnt):

   $ doas fw_update -p /mnt *-firmware-*.tgz
   
Disk Encryption
---------------

When installing, the following instructions from the OpenBSD FAQ
worked to enable full disk encryption:

    https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq14.html#softraidFDE

The OpenBSD Handbook also has a helpful guide on this:

    https://www.openbsdhandbook.com/disk_operations/encryption/

Screen
------

1. Touchscreen Calibration

   After installation, my Surface Go 2's touchscreen was not well
   calibrated.  The following page was very helpful in calibrating
   the touchscreen:

   https://www.tumfatig.net/2021/calibrate-your-touch-screen-on-openbsd/

   One minor note, on the Surface Go 2, the touchscreen wasn't
   automatically detected by xtsscale.  Instead, I needed to do
   the following:

   $ xtsscale -c -d /dev/wsmouse0

   and add the output to /etc/wsconsctl.conf

2. Setting the screen's color temperature

   2.1. Install sct:

        $ doas pkg_add sct

   2.2. Add the following to ~/.xsession:

        /usr/local/bin/sct [temp]

        I use 4800 for [temp].

3. The the screen's default brightness can be set by adding
   the following to /etc/wsconsctl.conf:

   display.brightness=[brightness]%

   I use 2% as the [brightness].  

4. Changing the screen resolution:

   $ xrandr -s [size]
   
   From: https://how-to.fandom.com/wiki/How_to_change_screen_resolution_while_in_X-Windows

5. Changing the mouse pointer size:

    5.1. Install lxappearance:

         $ doas pkg_add lxappearance

    5.2. Run lxappearance and chose a larger pointer:

         $ lxappearance &

Trackpad
--------

1. Layout

   Perhaps this should be obvious, but I did not realize that
   the Surface Go 2's trackpad support three mouse buttons:

        +-----------------------+
        |                       |
        |          [L]          |
        |                       |
        |                       |
        +----------[M]-------[R]+

   The left mouse button is most of the trackpad, while the
   right mouse button is in the lower right of the trackpad,
   and the middle mosue button in the lower center of the
   trackpad.

2. For Xemacs, to allow for scrolling via the trackpad, I had
   to add the following to ~/.xemacs/custom.el:

    ;; trackpad scrolling

    (setq scroll-conservatively 101)
    (global-set-key [mouse-4] 'scroll-down-command)
    (global-set-key [mouse-5] 'scroll-up-command)

Performance
-----------

The Surface Go 2 is usable, but not fast.  One setting (which
is disabled by default for security reasons) that improved
performance slightly was enabling hyperthreading by adding
the following to /etc/sysctl.conf (and then rebooting):

    hw.smt=1                # enable hyperthreading
